# ===== 1. Coding Standards =====

  - React Router v6+
- All components must be functional components.
- Use Hooks instead of class components.

- Keep components clean, readable, and modular.

# ===== 2. Folder Structure Rules =====
Follow the exact structure below:

src/
  api/
    apiSlice.ts
  components/
    common/
      Button.tsx
      LoadingSpinner.tsx
    layout/

- Cursor must never create new folders not listed above unless I request it.
- If a file belongs to a category, place it inside the correct folder.

# ===== 3. State Management Rules =====
- Use Redux Toolkit for global state.
- Use RTK Query for API calls instead of axios.
- Product data and Cart data MUST be handled through slices.

# ===== 4. UI/UX Development Rules =====
- Follow modern Tailwind utility classes.
- Spacing must follow 4px scale (p-2, p-4, p-6...).
- Use consistent colors and shadows.
- IMPORTANT: All UI must match the provided Figma design.
- If a UI element exists in Figma, reproduce it exactly using Tailwind.

# ===== 5. Routing Rules =====
- Use React Router DOM v6.
- Create routes for:
  /               → Home
  /product/:id    → ProductDetail
  /cart           → Cart

# ===== 6. API Communication Rules =====
- All API endpoints must go in api/apiSlice.ts
- Use createApi + fetchBaseQuery
- No inline fetch() inside components.

# ===== 7. Typography & Layout Rules =====
- Use Tailwind responsive breakpoints:
  sm / md / lg / xl / 2xl
- Follow mobile-first design.
- Use consistent typography from Figma:
  - Bold titles
  - Medium subtitles
  - Normal body text

# ===== 8. Component Human-Style Rules =====
- Code must feel like written by a skilled human developer.
- Keep variable names meaningful.
- Add comments where needed for clarity.
- No unnecessary complexity.
- Maintain clean indentation and file organization.

# ===== 9. Generation Rules =====
- When I ask for a component, generate:
  1. The `.tsx` file content
  2. Tailwind-friendly HTML
  3. Types if needed
  4. Place it in the correct folder
- NEVER include placeholder text like:
  "Add your code here"

# ===== 10. Figma Integration Rules =====
- Always follow the layout, spacing, colors, and structure shown in the Figma file:
  https://www.figma.com/design/tTCmmnG8xBZUhCDjODJJjs/Full-E-Commerce-Website-UI-UX-Design--Community-?node-id=1-3

- All UI components MUST visually match Figma unless I request changes.

# ===== 11. Error Handling Rules =====
- Handle loading states with LoadingSpinner.tsx
- Handle errors with human-like messages using Tailwind alerts.

# ===== 12. Reusability Rules =====
- Do NOT duplicate code.
- Move repeated logic into:
  - /components/common
  - /utils
  - /hooks

# ===== 13. Quality Rules =====
- Code must compile with zero TypeScript errors.
- Tailwind classes must be valid.
- React Router must be configured properly.

# ===== 14. Commitment Rules =====
- Always follow these rules unless I explicitly say: "ignore rules".
- Respond as an expert senior developer.
